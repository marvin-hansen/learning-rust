# Chapter 10.3: lifetime

Lifetimes are another kind of generic that weâ€™ve already been using. 
Rather than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that references are valid as long as we need them to be.

Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. 
We only must annotate types when multiple types are possible.
